* Add Portfolio Choice (ConsIndShockPortModel.py?)
   * Standard Merton/Samuelson type risky/safe
   * Set up so that expectations can be estimated:
      * Find beliefs that would rationalize a given outcome

   * Automobiles
   * Houses
   * Generic illiquid assets
   * Choice of saving 'rule' or portfolio 'rule'
      * Saving: This is like withholding from paycheck
